	    + AutoCapitalization ...
		Tools->AutoCorrect->Correct TWo initial Capitals
		this option is useful for writer, but useless for calc
		need to be able to disable it for oocalc but not write
		currently setting is shared; ie. enter HEllo in writer
		should result in 'Hello' and you should be able to enter
		HEllo into an oocalc cell.

+ Bug fixage

		+ The 'raise' issue - re-instate gui-appear.diff
		+ re-arrange default toolbars X#39088

		  show icons erroneously
