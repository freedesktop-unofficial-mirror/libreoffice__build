** Misc. tasks that need doing **

Michael's bits
	+ 1.1 release bits
		+ alpha bits ...
		+ new package
		+ faster toolbar render (XRender ?)
		+ [ documentation ? ]
	+ Improve /tmp/philipp, commit, & file in IZ.
	+ Documentation
		+ png import / render inside xmlhelp
		+ mapping / clobbering the icons in pictures.jar
	+ check out Philipp's cws_srx645_cups01
	+ more layout research ...
		+ respond to feedback
	+ printing-integration
		+ design a system for VCL/print dialog
		  integration
			+ VCL print dlg is sub-classed ?
			+ knobble it in the right place
			+ examine the Gnome alternative
	+ gtk+ integration
		+ cross toolkit modality (?)
		+ test with autosave dlg popup & NAS output.
	+ UDK installation + pkgconfig file
		+ need a 'post-setup-install' shell-script that
		  Debian can use as well ...
	+ Gnome
		+ finish bonoboui/samples/thread-demo
	+ VCL
		+ re-rendering flicker, we have a black b/g somehow.
		+ toolbox re-sizing flash/bang on tear-offs.

Martin
	+ cope with LANG problems:
		+ we need a new LC_ aware variant of the getLocale foo ...
		+ it should simplify the code-pattern in i18n-*.diff, so we
		  don't have to construct the string externally with cut and
		  paste.
		+ OUString osl::getProcessLocale( enum { LANG, LC_CTYPE, etc. } );
		  should work nicely I guess [ an osl:: enum of course ].
	+ evo ab connector - not passing utf-8 names through right
		+ m_aCurrentLine->getTextEncoding - UTF8 ?
		+ cf. source/drivers/file/FConnection.cxx - m_nTextEncoding.
		+ Seems like we get the right string / encoding.
		+ is it simply a rendering problem ?
	+ tbxcust
		+ right click -> customize on toolbar, add a new item, hit Icon,
		+ code needs re-writing to use BitmapEx's internally
	+ toolbar zoom combo box: add fit to page width etc.
	+ Longer term
	    	+ Bonobo component
		+ file selector integration

+ Bug fixage
	+ disable-crash-dialog.diff doesn't: somehow the
	  signal setup is really strange / broken in here, needs
	  cleanup / comprehensibility.
	+ not using autofmt.tbl (according to Jody (?))
	+ auto pop-down on toolbar color selector
	+ gccinstlib.pl fixes for stock RH compiler build
		+ overcome libstdc++ versioning nasties
		+ external/gcc3_specific/makefile.mk
		+ need to extract the filenames for the tar.gz
		+ add a --enable-system-compiler flag to configure
	+ LDAP integration
		+ currently done with mozilla: #17187
			+ implementation blows huge chunks
			+ impossible without a heavily patched mozilla
				- removes profile locking (unsafe)
				- mangles the LDAP code (not processing event queue)
				  http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/widget/src/gtk2/nsAppShell.cpp#200
		+ strategy: wait for evolution to provide a sane OOP API
		  do glib integration & wait for that.
	+ make patches/apply.pl understand --dry-run.

+ New features
	+ openoffice-gallery-extra
		+ turn all the dia diagram shapes into clipart.
	+ UI loving
		+ scroll-wheel pageup/down shouldn't show irritating
		  tooltips in writer/spreadsheet, only when paging
		  up/down/drag-scroll.
		+ F3 -> Open File (again)
		+ re-arrange default toolbars X#39088
		+ menu shortcut text should be 'Ctrl'+A (not 'Control')
		+ changing font size doesn't scale all widgets
		  eg. toolbar combo boxes & labels, file selector fields.
		+ mark-up all option menus correctly so they don't
		  show icons erroneously
		+ bin LHS padding on menus with no icons or
		  check-boxes, bin RHS padding with no K/B shortuts.
		+ use gnome-print dialogs for printer selection
		+ toolbar icons move on mouse-over; shouldn't.
	+ right click on image -> 'save as'
	+ Investigate full fontconfig speedups
		+ are we still loading stuff from the OO.o font cache?
		+ if so can we bin that; grok ascent/descent stuff.
	    	+ Check our pspfontcache isn't growing [ #9969 ? ]
			- pwrt. PDF printing & fontconfig bits ...
	+ Evolution as the default entry in Mail/Merge source wizard.
	+ session management
	+ printer authentication dialog
	+ Automatic font obliquing from Xft2 [?]
	+ file handling
		+ handle relative paths eg. ooffice ./file.sxi
		+ offer to create non-existant files
	+ no in-page search in help
	+ automatic gconf HTTP proxy fetch
	+ encrypted XL workbook support
	+ regexp searches in Writer.
	+ Make all GUI symbol rendering:
		vcl/source/window/decoview.cxx (DrawSymbol) use nice
		icons instead.
	+ writer
		+ mouse in margins, should trigger new cursor and row
		  selection mode
		+ mouse above/over table header, should allow col
		  selection + cursor
		+ encryption: sw/source/core/sw3io/sw3misc.cxx, line 689
	+ impress
		+ PPT load/save doesn't save slide names [!]
		+ grouped PPT presentation transitions are munged
		  into many individual interactions on import.
		+ sd/source/ui/dlg/*.cxx: improve time handling, for
		  sub-1 second durations.
		+ slides view -> more aggressive thumbnail caching
		  for speed
		+ drawing view needs LHS panel with scrollable
		  slides-view for navigation
		+ right click -> rename slide -> default
		  focus/selection should be existing slide name.
	+ calc
		+ select rows, right click show/hide
			+ should sensitize dependant on selection
		+ sheet tab font ugly & cramped
		+ insert a row group in oocalc
			+ 2nd from bottom toolbar icon on LHS
			+ expand / collapse button doesn't theme
		+ re-size toolbar color selector
		+ XL encryption: sc/source/filter/excel/impop.cxx (SC_XCL_USEDECR)
	+ fontconfig, open issues
		+ AA fonts + fontconfig path fixups ...
			+ pFont->m_aEncoding: symbol or not ...
			+ getting ascent / descent info from
			  fontconfig's FT_Face (cf. pangoft2.c)
			+ bin the nDirID nonsense ...
			+ font-collections (?) [ttcs]
			+ looks like we must retain the fontcache for
			  lone afms.
			+ font width issue ...
	+ printing - further work
		+ paper tray selection
		+ paper type selection
	+ make -quickstart useful
		+ get X session lifecycle right
	+ gtk+ mainloop integration possibilities:
		+ move 'getstyle-gnome' in-process
		+ bonobo integration ? ...
		+ mozilla/bonobo integration ? ...
	+ native at-spi bridge avoiding java cf. doc/accessibility.txt
	+ Mono integration
		+ http://udk.openoffice.org/cli/cli-uno.html
		+ pwrt. macro implementation.

+ Upstreaming
	+ recent-files needs de-glib-ifying.
	+ re-write the alpha icon / toolbox rendering bits ...
		+ apparently there should be no problem with VCL's
		  alpha rendering here ...

+ Testing
	+ do we need inst-destdir.diff in 1.1

+ Study
	+ investigate the menu's 'pLogo' code for branding.
	+ do we need vcl/source/window/window.cxx (maPaintTimer)
	  (30ms)? before re-painting the UI ? can we do it 
	  cumulatively for instant response 1st time ?
