** Misc. tasks that need doing **

Michael's bits
	+ Startup Notification
		+ currently have a bug if you start a
		  2nd instance, using the factory ... (doh)
	+ research a native at/spi bridge	
		+ avoids evil Java dependency
	+ more layout research ...
		+ respond to feedback
	+ file selector integration
	+ printing-integration
		+ design a system for VCL/print dialog
		  integration
			+ VCL print dlg is sub-classed ?
			+ knobble it in the right place
			+ examine the Gnome alternative
	+ gtk+ integration
		+ cross toolkit modality (?)
	+ fix disable-mozilla to use SCPDEFS as per config-switches
	+ Bonobo component
		+ UDK installation + pkgconfig file
			+ need a 'post-setup-install' shell-script that
			  Debian can use as well ...
		+ in-proc Bonobo/Writer component
	+ add a 'clean' rule to bin/Makefile.am
	+ Gnome
		+ finish bonoboui/samples/thread-demo

Federico
	+ 'new' icons still broken in packaged version ...
		+ default window decoration icon salframe.cxx (SetIcon)

Martin
	+ toolbar zoom combo box: add fit to page width etc.

+ Bug fixage
	+ disable-crash-dialog.diff doesn't: somehow the
	  signal setup is really strange / broken in here, needs
	  cleanup / comprehensibility.
	+ use catch-endif to remove scads of warnings.
	+ re-build the documentation with the new icons
	+ not using autofmt.tbl (according to Jody (?))
	+ auto pop-down on toolbar color selector
	+ gccinstlib.pl fixes for stock RH compiler build
		+ overcome libstdc++ versioning nasties
		+ external/gcc3_specific/makefile.mk
		+ need to extract the filenames for the tar.gz
		+ add a --enable-system-compiler flag to configure
	+ LDAP integration
		+ currently done with mozilla: #17187
			+ implementation blows huge chunks
			+ impossible without a heavily patched mozilla
				- removes profile locking (unsafe)
				- mangles the LDAP code (not processing event queue)
				  http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/widget/src/gtk2/nsAppShell.cpp#200
		+ strategy: wait for evolution to provide a sane OOP API
		  do glib integration & wait for that.

+ New features
	+ UI loving
		+ re-arrange default toolbars X#39088
		+ menu shortcut text should be 'Ctrl'+A (not 'Control')
		+ changing font size doesn't scale all widgets
		  eg. toolbar combo boxes & labels, file selector fields.
		+ mark-up all option menus correctly so they don't
		  show icons erroneously
		+ bin LHS padding on menus with no icons or
		  check-boxes, bin RHS padding with no K/B shortuts.
		+ use gnome-print dialogs for printer selection
	+ right click on image -> 'save as'
	+ Evolution as the default entry in Mail/Merge source wizard.
	+ session management
	+ printer authentication dialog
	+ file handling
		+ handle relative paths eg. ooffice ./file.sxi
		+ offer to create non-existant files
	+ no in-page search in help
	+ automatic gconf HTTP proxy fetch
	+ encrypted XL workbook support
	+ regexp searches in Writer.
	+ writer
		+ mouse in margins, should trigger new cursor and row
		  selection mode
		+ mouse above/over table header, should allow col
		  selection + cursor
	+ impress
		+ PPT load/save doesn't save slide names [!]
		+ grouped PPT presentation transitions are munged
		  into many individual interactions on import.
		+ sd/source/ui/dlg/*.cxx: improve time handling, for
		  sub-1 second durations.
		+ slides view -> more aggressive thumbnail caching
		  for speed
		+ drawing view needs LHS panel with scrollable
		  slides-view for navigation
	+ calc
		+ select rows, right click show/hide
			+ should sensitize dependant on selection
		+ sheet tab font ugly & cramped
		+ insert a row group in oocalc
			+ 2nd from bottom toolbar icon on LHS
			+ expand / collapse button doesn't theme
		+ re-size toolbar color selector
	+ fontconfig, open issues
		+ AA fonts + fontconfig path fixups ...
			+ pFont->m_aEncoding: symbol or not ...
			+ getting ascent / descent info from
			  fontconfig's FT_Face (cf. pangoft2.c)
			+ bin the nDirID nonsense ...
			+ font-collections (?) [ttcs]
			+ looks like we must retain the fontcache for
			  lone afms.
			+ font width issue ...
	+ printing - further work
		+ paper tray selection
		+ paper type selection
	+ make -quickstart useful
		+ get X session lifecycle right
	+ gtk+ mainloop integration possibilities:
		+ move 'getstyle-gnome' in-process
		+ bonobo integration ? ...
		+ mozilla/bonobo integration ? ...

+ Upstreaming
	+ recent-files needs de-glib-ifying.
	+ re-write the alpha icon rendering code
		+ can we use the Xft2 API ?
		+ otherwise a roundtrip / composite, or XRender thing
			+ will need to use GdkRGB.

+ Testing
	+ do we need inst-destdir.diff in 1.1

+ Study
	+ investigate the menu's 'pLogo' code for branding.
	+ do we need vcl/source/window/window.cxx (maPaintTimer)
	  (30ms)? before re-painting the UI ? can we do it 
	  cumulatively for instant response 1st time ?
