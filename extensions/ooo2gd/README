This directory only contains the ant build file (build.xml) that you can use 
to build ooo2gd extension from http://code.google.com/p/ooo2gd .  To use, 
check out the sources from their repository and replace their build.xml with 
ours.

  svn checkout http://ooo2gd.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/\ ooo2gd repo
  cd repo
  cp ../build.xml ./
  [...edit build.xml to taylor to your system...]
  ant pack

Note the whitespace in front of the directory name 'ooo2gd', which the author
mistakenly put it thinking it was to satisfy Google's intention.  Anyway, he
has no intention of fixing it, so we'll have to deal with that. :-/

I last tried it with version 2.1.0.  So, if you are trying to build later 
versions you may need to update our build.xml.
