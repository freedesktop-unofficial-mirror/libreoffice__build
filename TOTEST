	+ new window & per-desktop creation / raise behavior
	+ default bullet size is same size as MS
	+ test sc 'merge&center' button (sc-merge-cell.diff)
	+ GnomeVFS integration
		+ being build in m76
	+ ~/.recently-used & mime-type setting
		+ buggy / evil doesn't reflect other apps usage.
	+ icons & check-buttons showing in toolbar configuration menus
	  [ and not elsewhere ] - recheck in m76
	+ Web Bullet Export/ export to png not gif
		+ re-validate in clean build.

Hackers only:

	+ are we doing an optimising link ?

Win32 bits:
	+ ODMA / Win32 - badly needs finishing.
	+ Win32/Java build (win32-sjlib.diff)
