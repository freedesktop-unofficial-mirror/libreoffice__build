* This file contains things to re-validate vs. 1.1.x

+ getting right font from alias per locale (vcl-gtk-fontconfig-fonts)
+ keyboard accelerators
	+ apparently setup changed

Pending / known broken:
	+ test sc 'merge&center' button (sc-merge-cell.diff)
	+ ~/.recently-used & mime-type setting
		+ buggy / evil doesn't reflect other apps usage.
	+ Web Bullet Export/ export to png not gif
		+ re-validate in clean build.

Hackers only:
	+ are we doing an optimising link ?

Win32 bits:
	+ ODMA / Win32 - badly needs finishing.
	+ Win32/Java build (win32-sjlib.diff)
	+ Win32 file-bug toolbar icon
