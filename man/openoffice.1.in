.SH DESCRIPTION
OpenOffice.org is a fully featured office suite for the daily use with all
features you'd normally expect in a office suite.

This script runs OpenOffice with the arguments <args> given on the command line

There are also some wrapper scripts in /usr/bin which are calling the "normal"
openoffice script and run the wanted OpenOffice.org module.

.SH OPTIONS
These arguments are passed directly to the real start binary by the wrapper.
.TP
\fB[FILE]...\fR
Files to operate on. Opening them is the default behaviour, which can be
influenced by command line arguments. \fB\-p\fP will print the files instead.
.TP
\fB\-accept=\fR
This command line parameter provides an uno accept string to the
office. The accept string is used to create an acceptor thread.

"socket," = Uses the socket implementation to create an acceptor.
Currently used by scripting clients to access the OpenOffice.org API.
.TP
\fB\-display \fIDISPLAYNAME\fR
This option specifies the X server to contact; see \fBX\fR(7x)
.TP
\fB\-invisible\fB
The office doesn't show the intro bitmap during startup and doesn't
open the first default document. After startup there is no visible UI
although using the Office API it is possible to open visible
documents/dialogs. The only way to shutdown the office is through the
Office API or using the task manager / kill command.
.TP
\fB\-minimized\fR
This argument only controls the visibility of the intro bitmap during startup.
There is no code that minimizes the first window after startup.
If you never want the intro to show up, you can set Logo=0 in 
\fI/etc/openoffice/sofficerc\fP
.TP
\fB\-norestore\fR
Don't restart office and restore all opened documents automatically after an
exception. It is possible OOo will try to restore a file it keeps crashing on,
if that happens \-norestore is the only way to start OOo.
.TP
\fB\-p ...\fR
.br
"Print" command to print all following files on the default printer.
The office doesn't show the intro bitmap during startup. 
.TP
\fB\-pt ...\fR
"Print to" command to specify an additional printer for output. The
office doesn't show the intro bitmap during startup.
.TP
\fB\-quickstart\fR
Specifies that the quickstarter service should be activated during
startup. The office doesn't show the intro bitmap during startup. If you
use this option for a 2nd office this command is send to the running
office and activates the quickstarter.
.TP
\fB\-server\fR
This argument is like -invisible, additionally the ucb component is
configured using the configuration key
/org.openoffice.ucb.Configuration/ContentProviders/['Server']/SecondaryKeys/['Office']/ProviderData
instead of
/org.openoffice.ucb.Configuration/ContentProviders/['Local']/SecondaryKeys/['Office']/ProviderData
to support a remote file system. This configuration data is NOT included
in OpenOffice so normally you cannot use it. Please use -invisible
instead. 

There are some limitations for this command line argument. All "open",
"print", "print to" commands on the command line are ignored. No default
document is opened. After startup there is no visible UI although using
the Office API it is possible to open visible documents/dialogs. The
only way to shutdown the office is through the Office API or using the
task manager / kill command.
.TP
\fB\-terminate_after_init\fR
The office terminates after it registers some uno services. The office
doesn't show the intro bitmap during startup.

.SH TROUBLESHOOTING PROBLEMS
If OOo crashes, you should get a GUI bug reporting tool, please use
that to file a helpful bug report, or see http://ooo.ximian.com/hackers-guide.html
for more information on debugging OOo.
