This directory allows to fix or update localizations of some strings via the
.sdf files rather than by patches.


FIXME: All *.sdf file below this directory are applied during build. There is
       is no stamp support, so they are applied again and again...
              
       You should put the full localizations GSI_<lang>_<country>.sdf into the
       above directory. They are applied only once and only for selected
       localizations.       

       See ooo-build/bin/localize-ooo for more details.


FIXME: It would be nice to improve support in this area. We should be able to 
       extract ooo-build specific strings a simply way. We should be able
       to convert them between .po and .sdf files, ...
