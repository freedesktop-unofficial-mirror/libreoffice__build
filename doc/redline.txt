Notes on debugging redlining: from caolan.

Delphic utterances:

    "redlining sort of busted in the core for many things, but on the
     basic ww8 side, it's fairly easy: Read_CRevisionMark in ww8par4.cxx"

    "perhaps adding some prints to the ReadPlainChars and then
     to sw:util::RedlineStack:: open & close might throw the
     problem out"

    "could be a corrupt, or reading corrupt srpms property,
     sometimes there are places where we get the length of
     properties wrong, and so lose one"
	"if the dates are whacked, then there might be some
	 buggery along those lines"

    "though writer's redlining is foul, word's is simply an
     attribute like bold/italic. writer's is a sort of
     bag-on-the-side et of indexes into places, and doesn't
     work well with graphics and tables
    "so we have to cut up the word span into little mini
     "acceptable to writer" spans when the redline range
     encompases eg. text table text so someting might have
     gone wrong in a place like that too"

     "in *theory* in *theory*, though I don't think it ever
      happens those redline properties could appear in styles
      and not as hard-attributes during text. No idea if we
      ever handled that case, but that's unlikely. It'll be a
      more prosaic out by one or something"
