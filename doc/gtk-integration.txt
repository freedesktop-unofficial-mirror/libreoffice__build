Some blurb about gtk+ integration pain:

* gtk+

** main-loop

	+ can more than 1 thread be in the main-mainloop at once ?
	+ how about re-enterant loop processing ?
		loop -> event -> [other thread] -> loop ?
	+ do we share a lock for X events, and for rendering ?


* vcl

	+ we drop our lock as we poll
	+ we then re-take any locks & re-poll with the guard taken.
		+ cf. saldata.hxx's YieldMutexReleaser.
	+ we do not XInitThreads ...
	+ we guard XNextEvent etc. with the YieldMutex
		+ cf. 


* Integration
	+ We cannot allow a gtk+ and a VCL thread to use X
	  at the same time ... [ vicious ]
		+ is it the case that X is used from multiple
		  threads in VCL currently ?

	+ If we could share a lock we'd have to synchronize
	  locking semantics completely.
