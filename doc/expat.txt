The problems with expat: in text form.

	* a dmake in expat produces 2 libraries:
		ascii_expat_xmlparse, and expat_xmlparse used by:
		EXPATASCII3RDLIB      and EXPAT3RDLIB

	libexpat_xmlparse:
		+ sax/source/expatwrap - UNO XML interfaces.
	libascii_expat_xmlparse:
		+ ucb/source/ucp/webdav/makefile.mk - webdav support.
		+ xmlhelp - help system.

	The modified version is compiled eg.
(expat/unxlngi4.pro/misc/build/expat/xmlparse/makefile.mk) with:

UNICODECDEFS+=-DXML_UNICODE

	The libexpat_xmlparse code - is linked into a dlopened'
component library that has it's symbols stripped down to only a few C
'component' symbols. So - this is not the problem.

	Conclusion: ensure we link only with EXPATASCII3RDLIB.
