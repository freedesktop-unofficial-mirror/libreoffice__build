The following cryptographics code has been found in OOo:

svx/source/msfilter/mscodec.cxx:
    + does simple XOR encryption, it was moved from sc/sc/source/filter/excel/xistream.cxx
      as of OOo-2.0
    + also hooks into rtl_Digest_* from sal/rtl/source/digest.c
    
sal/rtl/source/cipher.c:
    + implements block ciphers:
	+ Blowfish - blocksize = 8; keylenght does not seem to be limited
    + implements stream ciphers:
	+ ARC4 - key lenght does not seem to be limited

sal/rtl/source/crc.c:
    + does CRC redundancy check

sal/rtl/source/digest.c:
    + implements digest algorithms:
	+ MD2, MD5, SHA, SHA1, HMAC_MD5, HMAC_SHA1

module libxmlsec:
    + uses system libnss (mozilla) to get crypto functions

modules xmlsecurity:
    + uses system libnss (mozilla) to get the crypto functions
    + the libnss code is currently duplicated in the OOo sources
      (system-mozilla-xmlsecurity-libnss.diff) until the system
      mozilla provides a missing symbol. It could be removed for
      SL 9.3-final.

Sources of the zlib library (used for compression) and python-2.2.2 are
no loger included in the stripped source tarball.
