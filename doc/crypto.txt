Crypto use in ooo-build/OOO

** TODO
   svx/source/msfilter/mscodec.cxx
	+ does simple XOR encryption
	+ also hooks into rtl_Digest_*
   sal/rtl/cipher.c (& crc.c ?)

   XML document encryption & signing - lots of new code here
       + 'xmlsecurity/' (?)
	 - links to mozilla
	 + where this all lurks ( uses libxmlsec I think )

        SL92: OpenOffice_org-1.1.2

The main URL is: http://www.openoffice.org/

OpenOffice.org supports an XOR-based data encryption. The Algorithms are 
visible at e.g.: 
http://sc.openoffice.org/source/browse/sc/sc/source/filter/excel/xistream.cxx

Digest  Algorithms (MD2, MD5, SHA, SHA1, HMAC_MD5, HMAC_SHA1) appear in

http://sc.openoffice.org/source/browse/sal/rtl/source/digest.c

Sources of the zlib library (used for compression) are included as well as 
python-2.2.2

Microsoft Office 97 Encryption (as exposed  in 
http://www.csn.ul.ie/~caolan/Packages/wvDecrypt.html) is not yet supported.
