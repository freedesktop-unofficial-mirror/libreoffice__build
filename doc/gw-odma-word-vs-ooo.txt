Comparing GW integration in Word and OOo.

In an empty app, write some text and do "Exit"
- If GW running:
  - Word:
        "Do you want to save the changes to ..."
        [ Yes ] [ No ] [ Cancel ]

        Yes -> 

        "Document Save As"
                  [ ] Save Document Using Application Dialog
                  [x] Save As New Document
		  [ ] greyed out: Save as New Document
        [ OK ] [ Options] [ Cancel ]

        OK -> 

        GW dialog "Select a Library and Folder" flashes orange in taskbar
        etc
        
  - OOo:
        "The document Untitled1 has been  modified. Do you want to save the changes?"
        [ Save ] [ Discard ] [ Cancel ]

        Save ->

        OOo's "Save as" dialog". No visual indication of possibility
        to save in DMS. The File name input box is empty, and has a
        dropdown menu of previous documents, those from ODMA are as
        URIs starting with vnd.sun.star.odma:. But we want to save as
        a new document, so that is not really helpful.

- If GW not running:
  - Word:
        "Do you want to save the changes to ..."
        [ Yes ] [ No ] [ Cancel ]

        Yes ->

        "GroupWise Integration" dialog: This application uses
        GroupWise Libraries to store documents. GroupWise is not
        currently running. To save or retrieve documents in a
        GroupWise Library, you must first start GroupWise. 
	[ ] Do not display the message again.  

	[ OK ]

        OK ->

        Normal Windows file Save As dialog.

  - OOo:
        "The document Untitled1 has been  modified. Do you want to save the changes?"
        [ Save ] [ Discard ] [ Cancel ]

        Save ->

        OOo's "Save as" dialog". Again no mention of GroupWise or
        ODMA. vnd.sun.star.odma URIs visible in history dropdown.

        OOo's "Save As" dialog, this time with vnd.sun.star.odma:/ as
        the displayed "folder", without any contents though.  The File
        name box contains the edited document version's URI without
        the version number. Hmm. No apparent discoverable way to save
        as new document in GW.


====
Open document from GW, edit it, do "Save As"
        As previous case.
