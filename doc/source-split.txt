  - see git/ooo-link-modules.list for what should belong where

- ooo-bootstrap
  - scp2 must be split and the respective part present in each ooo-*/ure, not
    in ooo-bootstrap!
  - ln -s ../ooo-artwork/default_images . in ooo-bootstrap (or where the
    solver is) so that vcl builds [needs the checkbox etc. images]

- ooo-libs-guitoolkit
  - vcl does not compile without access to default_images - needs them for the
    checkboxes etc.
    Workaround: ln -s ../ooo-artwork/default_images . in ooo-bootstrap (or
    where the solver is)

- ooo-libs-3rdparty
  - cli_types.dll should be delivered to the solver so that ure/cli_ure compiles.

- ure
  - javaunohelper/com/sun/star/comp/juhtest does not compile without ucb, must
    be disabled (together with javaunohelper/com/sun/star/comp)
