	+ 62181 - password protected documents
		+ CWS modules are: sc, sw, sd, svx, sal, uui
			+ Missing the 'svx' diff ! :-)
			+ sc - re-diff with -w - currently 7000 lines
				+ slightly complex CONTINUE record
				  handling etc.
				+ A very large rename of stream API [!?]
				    aIn.ReadByteString() rename
				    instead of aIn.AppendByteString.
				    aIn.Tell() vs. aIn.GetSvStreamPos()

			+ sw - 1270 lines re-diff with -w
				+ seems to include other code
				+ ww8par.cxx - seems to have a large
				  moved section - how large are the
				  changes really ?
			+ sd - trivial
			+ uui - trivial
			+ svx - trivial
