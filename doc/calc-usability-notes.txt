== Export as PDF does not export selected sheets ==

* The user wants to export the 2nd and 3rd sheets as pdf document.  
  So, she selects the 2nd and 3rd sheets by ctrl-click with the mouse 
  cursor.

* She clicks the "quick export to PDF" icon in the tool bar, but only 
  sees the first sheet exported as pdf.  Note that the first sheet is 
  not selected.
  
* She then tries File - Export as PDF menu, which brings up more 
  detailed pdf export options in the dialog.  She selects 'Selection' 
  in the Range option, and hits "Export" button at the bottom.  But 
  the pdf document still contains the first sheet, not the 2nd and 3rd 
  sheets that she wanted to export.  
  
* After lots of struggle, she realizes that her document has a 
  non-default print range set.  So she removes the print range by 
  Format - Print Ranges - Remove, then tries to export as PDF by File 
  - Export as PDF menu once again (and select 'Selection' in the Range 
  option).  
  
* This time she succeeds; the PDF document only contains the 2nd and 
  3rd sheets.  

== Unable to type a formula into a cell and have it computed. ==

* The user tries to type a formula expression into a cell, an 
  expression such as '=SUM(A1:A10)'.  

* However, even after hitting ENTER, that expression remains displayed 
  as-is, instead of it being interpreted and the result being 
  displayed.
  
* She then realizes that the format of that cell is set to TEXT, 
  resets it to Default and re-enters the formula.  This time, it gets 
  interpreted.
