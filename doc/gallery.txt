Notes on gallery defficiencies:

* Immidiate
    + turn gal.cxx into a command-line merge tool
    + ensure we get relative paths included


* Longer term To Do
    + Create a better thumbnail specification
	+ not based on 1 thumb/per/icon
	+ single large-image/strip thing.
	+ RGBA ?
	    + BitmapEx (?) [ upside down ]
	    + right-way-up etc.
	    + index file [?] [ directory ]
    + make gallery a tree-view widget
    + ensure we can get relative paths included
    + get a recursive structure setup somehow (?)
        + output .thm to some text format - not binary blob (?) [!?]
	+ why is any of this some random database ?
    + add search

+ extras/source/gallery/
	+ images etc. live here
+ svx/source/gallery2/
    + galtheme.cxx
	    + should be able to create a load of
		     + SgaObjectBmp

    + inc/galtheme.hxx:
	    + InsertObject (SgaObject )
	    	    + GetThumb -> bitmap

    + inc/galobj.hxx (SgaObject):
	    + SgaObjectBmp( const INetURLObject )
	    + or SgaObjectBmp( const Graphic *,const INetURLObject );

gallery1.hxx (Gallery)
    + GalleryTheme* AcquireTheme( const String& rThemeName, SfxListener& rListener );


Creates a theme: but no '.thm' file - required by AcquireFoo ...
	+ 'aThmURL'  (GalleryThemeEntry) -> GetThmURL


Inserts absolute URLs ...
