<caolan> michael_: locate your workspace on http://eis.services.openoffice.org/ , (logging in as mmeeks@openoffice.org)
<caolan> michael_: find it, edit it to set yourself as owner, and yourself as qa
<michael_> caolan: ok :-)
<caolan> michael_: reload it, and set "ready to qa", and reload again and in your qa role you set it to nominated
<caolan> michael_: theres some paperwork with seeing due dates and ready for qa dates, I guess setting them all to today/tomorrow will fudge past that
<caolan> michael_: I assume you already "cwsaddtask"ed the issues to the workspace ?
<michael_> caolan: sure, I added the tasks
* michael_ doesn't see how to edit it to set himself as owner

<caolan> michael_: if you're logged in right and view a workspace, then the "Data for child workspace" title is clickable and takes you to the edit page
<caolan> michael_: I had problems where I was logged in a guest or as cmc, not cmc@openoffice.org which was the magic missing ingredient
<michael_> caolan: intuitive :-)
* michael_ gets there -thanks.
<michael_> caolan: just fixing a bunch of cws tooling bugs hurting me :-)
--> sanxiyn (tinuviel@211.104.100.115) has joined #openoffice.org
<caolan> btw if it hasn't been mentioned, checkins with cvs comments including #iXXXXX# where XXXXX is the issue no get linked correctly by various bits of tooling e.g. http://eis.services.openoffice.org/EIS2/servlet/cws.ShowCWS?Id=1608&Path=SRC680%2Fsystemcurl1
<michael_> caolan: oh; so when it says Issue: it should have some #i # stuff in the template ?
* michael_ will write up a more complete CWS users guide from these tips :-)
<michael_> caolan: what format is the date in ?
* michael_ sees '-' delimited
<caolan> michael_: I've never seen the template, I've cvs commit -m"#ixxx# ..." as habit for long time
<caolan> michael_: as for dates, I think I used .de style dd.mm.yyyy, or maybe iso yyyy/mm/dd
<michael_> it doesn't like '/' but it doesn't mind '-' :-)
<michael_> caolan: so when it's nominated - you just hold your breath for a bit ? 
<caolan> hmm, cwsrecync seems to have borked for me on new files on the master
<caolan> michael_: integration requires human RE to do it, and its fri 17:42 in Hamburg, so I guess you'll see nothing happening until mon :-)
<michael_> that's no problem :-)
<michael_> caolan: just fixed cwsresync's idea of .cvspasswd parsing :-)
<caolan> unless Ratte is still at work and sees me say that and makes a point of fast tracking it
<michael_> heh;
* michael_ is in no hurry,
* michael_ 's tooling now appears to work fine so ...
<michael_> caolan: do you ever bother doing a resync of your cws in another directory ?
<caolan> michael_: today I want to do one, normally not, but I know there has been changes to something I've also changed, and I suspect it'll be non-trivial to merge unless you know what I'm at
