ooo-build allows to build OOo galleries from the Open Clip Art Library
that is available at http://www.openclipart.org/

The .png files included in the Open Clip Art Library sources are sufficient
just for preview. They are generated with the constant width 80, which is
not enough resolution for most of the graphics. Therefore, it is necessary
to generate the .png files by inkscape from the .svg sources.

To get the OOo galleries from Open Clip Art library, it is enough to use
the --with-openclipart configure switch and build and install OOo the
usual way:

    ./configure --with-openclipart
    ./download
    make
    make install or bin/ooinstall

The configure switch --with-openclipart accepts two types of parameters:

    a) version number

    It is useful if you want to build the galleries from the original
    Open Clip Art Library sources.

    b. path to prebuilt .png files
    
    It is useful if you have the .png files already prebuilt and installed
    somewhere on your system. Note that it takes a lot of time to rebuilt
    the .png files using inkscape. In addition, inkscape has huge dependecies
    on other packages, so some people might want to prebuilt the .png files
    apart from OOo.


Notes:

a) One gallery is generated for each top-level subdirectory of the Open Clip
   Art Library.
b) There is a blacklist in ./bin/build-galleries that allows to remove
   problematic files (broken, controversial, ...)
c) The following two lists of files are genereated if $OODESTDIR is defined:
	$BUILDDIR/openclipart.txt
	$BUILDDIR/galleries.txt
d) Xvfb is started if available and the X server does not seem to be accessible.
   It is necessary because the utility gengal tries to access the X server.


Implementation details:

The gallery related code is included in the following files:

    ./configure.in
    ./download
    ./bin/setup.in
    ./bin/unpack
    ./bin/ooinstall
    ./bin/build-galleries

These variables are set in ./bin/setup:

    OPENCLIPART_VER - is set if we build from original Open Clip Art Library sources
    OPENCLIPART_VER - is set if we use the prebuilt .png files
