OOo opens connection to session manager when SESSION_MANAGER
envirnment variable is set.

X Session Management is described here:
	http://www.xfree86.org/current/SMlib.pdf

On shutdown, the session manager sends SaveYourselfProc, so that app
can save it's state. (it also sends this at session management
checkpoint) At this point app can request interaction with user (if
allowed by SM). After save is completed (sends SaveCompleteProc) it
sends DieProc.

OOo now saves the data on save yourself and closes all the
frames. When it receives DieProc, all the frames are already closed
and so no interaction with user happens.

To make OOo display (interact) with user on GNOME session close
(logout/shutdown/restart) we will need to make OOo not to close frames
on SaveYourselfProc. It will make sense as it seems weird to close
documents on SM checkpoint too.
