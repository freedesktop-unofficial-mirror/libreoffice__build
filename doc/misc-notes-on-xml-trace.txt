Now, on to sfx2; SfxConfigManager seems to be the one that invoking all the xml process as part of createInstance...
Turns out that the xStorage thing --
 SotStorageRef xStorage( GetStorage( aCfgFileName, STREAM_STD_READ ) ); --
in sfx2\source\config\cfgmgr.cxx::SfxConfigManager() does all the xml storage stuff...

Though initially thought that the code in framework/ is the one handling these, the stuff in framework/  - like Moduleuiconfigurationmanager.cxx under source/configuration - comes in the path only after all the xml processing is done.

After the locale settings and creation of Resource manager, the createInstance invokes a series of library loads, speciafically libsfx and libfwe and like. The sfx and framework libraries.


cmduicollector.cxx - Seems to be handling all the xml files for menu, status toolbar and accelerator stuff.
Though, initially thought this could be the one processing, looks like it's some cmd line stuff.

Needs to explore these...
xml2cmp/source/xcd/filebuff.cxx::loadxmlfile()
xmlwrap.hxx::ScXMLImportWrapper
