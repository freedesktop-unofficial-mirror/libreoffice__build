Notes on Mono integration

+ Work from cli_ure
    + de-louse prj/build.lst dependencies
	+ check for MCS in config_office/configure.in, util/makefile.pmk
	+ rename csc -> $(CSC) & set it up right.
	    + mcs can't cope with '-o'
		  ** We should switch to -optimize instead. **

    + All(?) the C++ here is managed C++ (CFLAGS contains -clr)

    + source/native/native_bootstrap.cxx:
	+ ::com::sun::star::uno::Reference< foo >
	    + wrapped in a GC thing.
	+ 'to_cli' call ...
	    + source/native/native_share.h
		+ -> uno::Mapping
		+ -> System::Runtime::InteropServices
	+ The mapping implemented somewhere else !?
		+ cppu/inc/mapping.hxx
		+ LXR for 'uno_registerMapping'

+ bridges/source/cli_uno/*
    + Managed C++ (CFLAGS += -clr)

+ Decision
    + should attempt to link to & map specifically to Mono
	+ ie. a new binding bridges/source/mono_uno/*
	+ since we have no 'managed C++' equivalent
	+ ergo, no point in doing slow C->Mono calls that
	  then call more 'standard' .Net calls to do
	  conversions/boxing etc.
	+ Just map as directly to Mono types / layout
	  as possible.
