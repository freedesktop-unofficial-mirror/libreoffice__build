Notes on Mono integration

Building the Mono UNO bridge
============================

+ configure with --enable-mono
+ ./download
+ You absolutely need mono >= 1.1.6

+ Test with demo programs:

  cd odk/examples/CLI/CSharp/Spreadsheet
  mcs ViewSample.cs SpreadsheetDocHelper.cs  -r ../../../../../cli_ure/unxlngi4.pro/bin/cli_basetypes.dll  -r ../../../../../cli_ure/unxlngi4.pro/bin/cli_types.dll -r ../../../../../cli_ure/unxlngi4.pro/bin/cli_cppuhelper.dll -r ../../../../../cli_ure/unxlngi4.pro/bin/cli_ure.dll

  # To compile SpreadsheetSample.cs, you need mcs from mono 1.1.6 or
  # later, the others can be compiled with older mcs.

  mono ViewSample.exe


Notes on the Mono UNO bridge
============================

+ What works already?

    + "A little bit of everything" :-/

    + The ViewSample.cs which seems to work does:
        + get initial ComponentContext using bootstrap (i.e.
	  get a UNO interface wrapped in Mono object)
	+ test wrapped UNO objects for implented interfaces.
	+ call methods on Mono objects, parameters and return values
	  are mapped to/from UNO (numbers, strings, anies, structs,
	  inherited structs)
	+ pass a Mono implementation of a UNO interface
	  (XRangeSelectionListener) to UNO (i.e. wrap a Mono object in
	  a UNO interface)

+ What doesn't work/What's missing?

    + The other two spreadsheet examples crash when a method on the
      result of getSpreadsheet is invoked. The UnoProxy's Invoke
      method is never reached.

    + lots of FIXMEs near TypeDescription declarations: The
      corresponding C++ code uses a wrapper class for automatic
      acquire/release. The C# code doesn't and leaks TypeDescriptions

    + lots of FIXMEs in switch default: cases, after null checks:
      consistent error handling is missing here.

    + Exception handling is untested. (Catching UNO exceptions in Mono,
      throwing Mono exceptions to UNO)

    + testtools has a "bridgetest" for various bridges, also for cli.
      Haven't looked at it at all.

    + The reference counting for uno_Interfaces isn't correct. Rebuild
      cppu with debug=true to get statistics when UNO shuts down.

+ New source files:

    + cli_ure/source/bootstrap/* provide cppuhelper wrappers,
      analogous to cli_ure/source/native. The use of mono_gchandle_new
      in bootstrap/native_glue.cxx seems ugly.

    + bridges/source/mono_uno/* the Mono bridge. Ported from
      briges/source/cli_uno C++ code to C# and very thin C++
      glue. Most of the C# is translated statement by statement.
      [ Tried to use C# coding style and not use cli_uno's
      namespace. But failed sometimes ]

+ How do the wrappers work:

    + UnoProxy, wrapper for UNO objects that are used in Mono land

        + Uses Remoting, inherits RealProxy, i.e. all casts are 
	  checked with CanCastTo, all method invocations go through Invoke.
	  Almost statement by statement translation of UnoInterfaceProxy
	  from cli_uno's cli_proxy.cxx

    + MonoProxy, wrapper for Mono objects that are sent to UNO

        + Essentially the required function pointers (for uno_Interface)
	  and a GC handle for a ManagedProxy. Uses mono api to call
	  ManagedProxy methods
	  
	+ ManagedProxy is the translation of cli_uno's CliProxy.

+ What about the precompiled dll: It contains the CLI representations
  of structs, exceptions, enums, interfaces, etc. of udkapi and offapi.

  It was generated using climaker (see notes below). How to port that:

    + completely port it to C# and use the Mono UNO bridge. This would
      cause circular dependencies (cli_types.dll is needed to build
      the bridge) or:

    + Look at cilc (comes with mono) to make a C wrapper for
      Reflection.Emit and port the bytecode generation in climaker to
      use that.

+ Can I use Mono to write add-ins for OOo? No, there's no "component
  loader" for Mono yet. Not even for the Windows .Net Bridge.


Notes on the Windows dot Net bridge
===================================

+ Work from cli_ure
    + de-louse prj/build.lst dependencies
        + check for MCS in config_office/configure.in, util/makefile.pmk
        + rename csc -> $(CSC) & set it up right.
            + mcs can't cope with '-o'
                  ** We should switch to -optimize instead. **
        + rene has a patch for this
          http://people.debian.org/~rene/openoffice.org/mono.diff

    + All(?) the C++ here is managed C++ (CFLAGS contains -clr)

+ cli_ure/source/basetypes/uno
    + C# implementations according to
      http://udk.openoffice.org/common/man/draft/uno_dotnet_typemapping.html
      of uno.Any
    + Contrary to that specification, there is no MethodAttribute, but
      separate custom attributes for
        + Bound (UNO) attributes, (i.e. properties)
        + Exceptions that methods may throw
        + Oneway methods
    + PolymorphicType, TypeParameters Attribute (for classes), TypeArguments
      Attribute (for fields in classes with TypeParameters) to emulate UNO
      structs with type arguments.
    + compiles with msc without problems

+ cli_ure/source/climaker
    + takes one or more uno registry files (.rdb) and emits an assembly
      containing the mapped types, mapped according to:
      http://udk.openoffice.org/common/man/draft/uno_dotnet_typemapping.html
    + output looks like
      http://udk.openoffice.org/cli/download/CLI-UNO.zip - cli_types.dll
    + uses System.Reflection.Emit to build the assembly
    + uses the native C++ UNO binding to read the registry files and for
      reflection of UNO types
    + uses native C++ to be able to use OUString
    + Tests in cli_ure/tests/climaker

+ cli_ure/source/native
    + produces cli_cppuhelper.dll as found in CLI-UNO.zip
    + "Provides bootstrapping code to bootstrap native UNO"
    + native_share.h:
        + to_cli
            + get a mapping <compiler's c++ abi>->cli (uses the uno2cli
              mapping impl. in the cli_uno bridge)
            + it uses the C++ wrapper Mapping which consists entirely of
              inline functions that use the C uno_Mapping
            + get the CLI proxy
            + extracts the object reference from the returned GCHandle
        + to_uno -- unused (!)
            + get a mapping cli-><compiler's c++ abi>
            + wrap the object reference in a new GCHandle
            + get the C++ proxy
            + wrap it in com::sun::star::uno::Reference < T >
    + native_bootstrap.cxx:
        + implementation of defaultBootstrap_InitialComponentContext as used
          in cli_language_binding.sxw from CLI-UNO.zip
        + uses cppuhelper's C++ native defaultBootstrap_InitialComponentContext
        + then uses to_cli to make a cli proxy for the component context
        + some Windows delayLoadHook thing
    + this is an easy? candidate for rewriting in C#, with P/Invokable glue
      for cppuhelper's defaultBootstrap_InitialComponentContext.
    + (Java uses jni but also cppuhelper; apparently cppuhelper has the only
      implementation of defaultBootstrap...;
      javaunohelper/source/bootstrap.cxx)

+ cli_ure/source/ure/uno/util
    + C# Implementation cli_ure.dll from CLI-UNO.zip
    + "Contains helper classes which are useful for implementing UNO interfaces.
      Types from this assembly are not necessarily used"

    + WeakBase: base class for WeakComponentBase
    + DisposeGuard: IDisposable, "Helper class to conveniently auto dispose
      UNO objects from within managed code."

testtool problems
=================

Apply patches/test/mono-testtools.diff

It seems we're failing to bootstrap UNO; we have to
export the contents of unxlngi4.pro/lib/cli_bridgetest_inprocess.ini:

[Bootstrap]
UNO_TYPES=$SYSBINDIR/uno_types.rdb
UNO_SERVICES=$SYSBINDIR/uno_services.rdb

which helps. 

The bootstrapping code in:

sal/rtl/source/bootstrap.cxx uses 'getExecutableFile_Impl'
-> sal/osl/unx/source/process_impl.cxx (osl_bootstrap_getExecutableFile_Impl)
   -> grabs 'main' symbol, 

It may help to copy the mono binary locally to execute - since
a number of tasks do nasties with dlsym(main) -> where did main
come from.

There really is some disgraceful bootstrapping problem lurking in here.
Replacing the .ini file with simply:

[Bootstrap]
UNO_TYPES=uno_types.rdb
UNO_SERVICES=uno_services.rdb

yields some success ...

We also need (eg.) 'libsal.so' and this symlink is made only on
install: => add {install}/program to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

With more fixing we get:

CallUno member 'com.sun.star.lang.XMain::run'
Map parameter 0 '[]string'
dispatch 0x83abdb0
Thread attach, invoke 'com.sun.star.bridges.mono_uno.ManagedProxy:Dispatch (uno.Typelib.TypeDescription*,void*,void**,uno.Binary.Any**)'
exception occured: cannot get test object!

	new String [] {
	"com.sun.star.test.bridge.cli_uno.CsTestObject" } );
