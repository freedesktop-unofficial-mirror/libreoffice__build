	* sc/source/filter/excel/excrecds.cxx: seems we
	re-'compile' the spreadsheet to an XL form for
	export; good (ExcFormula)
	(XclExptExtNameAddIn) instantiated from (InsertAddIn)
	exccomp.cxx (CExcelCompiler::Factor), need hooks
	here. -> xelink.cxx (XclExpLinkManager::GetLinkManager) -> add link.
	Existing name write: (ptgName), (CExcelCompiler::IsNamedRange)
	-> token; -> 


	CExcelCompiler - sub-classed by 'ExcUPN':
	    GetData(), GetLen() - in-line.
	ExcUPN -> chains constructor and does:
	    rCodeType = CreateCode( ... );

	excrecds.cxx ExcFormula - creates ExcUPNs

	Ergo -> most work done in 'CreateCode'
	     'GetNextToken()'
	     'Expression()'
		-> complicated chained functions eg. 'PowLine'
		-> Unclear as to their function
		    -> What if a Concat is after a MulDiv ?

	    'Factor'
		-> Recurses through Expression [how odd]
		-> PutCode - outputs code ...


	    if (pSave->nParamCount == nVarParam)
		- output a param count too.

	ExcNameList::ExcNameList: GetExportIndex; index setup here.
	new 'ExcName' -> root->pNameList (?) [ new ExcNameList ]
	excrecds.cxx (ExcNameList::ExcNameList) sets up indexes etc.

Factor:
    + Outputs a Name record as well - highly convoluted & ugly code !
    + prolly quite buggy too.
    + Need to move name record output to link manager.
