If you want to build Novell version of OOo on a selected product, you should
use the following configure swithes:

Vendor is always the same:

    --with-vendor=Novell


Distribution depends on the product you want to built on. You can use the
following distro tags if you want to build on HEAD, such as a SUSE Linux
alpha or beta version:

    --with-distro=SUSE
or 
    --with-distro-NLD


You should use the following tags if you want to build on a released product:

    --with-distro=SUSE-MAJOR_VER.MINOR_VER
or
    --with-distro-NLD-VER
    
For example:

    --with-distro=SUSE-9.3
or
    --with-distro=NLD-9

We added extra configuration for each distribution because there were necessary
some product specific hacks. For example, system Berkley db cannot be used on
SUSE Linux < 10.1.

IMPORTANT: These are only the configure swithes. The configure script
translates the NLD tags to the respective SUSE tags and ONLY the SUSE
tags can be used on other locations inside ooo-build!!!

The translation is done because we have started to use the same packages
on both products since SL10.1/NLD10. The extra things for NLD are put into
the subpackage nld. Thereafter the build hacks have to be the same for NLD
and the respective SL version...

The current translation table looks like:

    NLD-9   ->   SUSE-9.1
   (NLD-10  ->   SUSE-10.1   - not yet released)
