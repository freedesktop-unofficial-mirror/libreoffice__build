* Chasing SuSE bug #46365

* Problem 1.4:
	+ winproc.xx (IpmlHandleExtTextInput):
		+ ImplHandleEndExtTextInput ...


	+ EndExtTextInput
	    + not doing it's job ?
	+ On non-IM keypress
	    + do a reset ?
	+ perhaps m_bWasPreedit problem (?)
	+ other events [ key move / delete etc. in-between bits ... ]


Method to reproduce problem 1.4:

GTK_IM_MODULE=xim XMODIFIERS=@im=SCIM oowriter

Shift+Space to switch on scim. Choose UIM-anthy input method.
Type 

    a a a RETURN RETURN
    a a a RETURN RETURN

You should now see:

あああ
あああ

Select all of this with the mouse. Press Delete. All text is deleted.
The input method is still switched on!
Type 

   a a a 

again. 

You cannot see any input.

Switch off input method with Shift+Space.

Type 

  a b c

Latin letters are inserted.

Switch on input method with Shift+Space. Now the 3 Japanese 'a' 
which were already typed before but didn't become visible are inserted.
The buffer now looks like:

abcあああ


So far:
	+ it looks like the IM setup / teardown / associate & de-associate
	  are not happening correctly - ie. on focus in / out / realise /
	  unrealise or whatever.
	    GtkEntry::realise
		+ gtk_im_context_set_client_window (entry->im_context, entry->text_area);
	    GtkEntry::unrealise
		+ gtk_im_context_set_client_window (entry->im_context, NULL);
	+ Different in OO.o ...

	+ OO.o has no:
	      gtk_im_context_set_cursor_location (entry->im_context, &area);

	+ Press <shift>-<space> - nothing happens
		+ Alt tab twice - suddenly it works
			+ some event emission / association not
			  happening correctly
		+ [ FocusIn ? before SetInputContext ? ]
	  

<maiku> There are different input styles:
<michael> ok;
<michael> so - we don't even toggle the keybinding thing
<maiku> 1) Overthespot: you input the あ in an extra window, after RETURN it is pasted into the application. The extra window is sometimes at weird positons.
<michael> ok;
<maiku> 2) OnTheSpot: you input the あ directly into the application. 
<michael> so - you can configure those in the settings somewhere ?
<maiku> In the scim setup menu.
<michael> so - to get this right; 'OnTheSpot' would insert some glyphs into the app, and then change them as you type more, and you would see no pop-up menu ?
<michael> s/pop-up menu/pop-up editing window/
<maiku> With OnTheSpot you see the scim panel, but no extra window as you type characters.
<maiku> The characters are directly inserted into the application and changed as you type more.
<michael> and does it wait until the character is complete before inserting it ?
<maiku> No, every keystroke is inserted immediately. 
<michael> so - the API provides a way to go back and remove / update previous characters right ?
<maiku> But if it is not complete yet, it is marked somehow. Maybe underlined or a different color.
<michael> this is extremely helpful :-)
<michael> thanks so much.

<maiku> I.e. you input "nihonn"
<maiku> That is immediately converted to にほん
<maiku> You don't press return then but Space instead.
<maiku> Space means "convert to Chinese characters". If you press Space you get 日本 which means "Japan"
<maiku> If the first conversion is not right (usually phonetics -> Chinese characters is not a unique conversion) you press Space again.
scim-gtk2-immodule-1.0.1-1.1
<maiku> Then you get another choice. If it still isn't right you keep pressing Space and get a selection box of all possibilities.

<michael> how does that interaction work - does the app register itself with xim ? or is it stolen at the Xserver level ?
* michael is still on GTK_IM_MODULE=scim
<maiku> The app calls some Xlib functions like XOpenIM().

** The problem:

<maiku> 1.4 is difficult to reproduce. Maybe I should better write instructions how to reproduce it 100% in Bugzilla, you know now how it works.
<maiku> Now the worse problem with GTK_IM_MODULE=scim.
<maiku> If you have 
<maiku> GTK_IM_MODULE=scim XMODIFIERS=@im=SCIM OOo
<maiku> you couldn't open the input method with Shift+Space at all.
<maiku> That was also in Takashi's bug report.
<maiku> Start OOo with 
<maiku> GTK_IM_MODULE=scim XMODIFIERS=@im=SCIM OOo
<maiku> verify that Shift+Space does nothing.
<maiku> verify that Shift+Space does nothing in oowriter.
<maiku> Now open a spread sheet from the file menu. In the spread sheet you can now activate the input in the entry widget above the table.
<maiku> Close the spread sheet again.
<maiku> Now you can activate the input in oowriter!!!
<maiku> Trying this once in the spread sheet made it work in oowriter.
<maiku> Surprising. 
<maiku> Apparently only one window at a time can have the input activated.
<maiku> I cannot reproduce this problem on my x86_64. On my x86_64, the
<maiku> behavior for GTK_IM_MODULE=scim is the same as for GTK_IM_MODULE=xim.
<maiku> In both cases, XIM is apparently used on x86_64.
<maiku> GTK_IM_MODULE=scim works fine on x86_64 with 64 bit applications like gedit.
<maiku> But OOo is a 32 bit application. I guess this is the reason why GTK_IM_MODULE=scim doesn't work or OOo on x86_64.
<maiku> Probably 32bit plugins for the input modules would be needed and they are not there.
<michael> :-)
<michael> yes; I can well believe that is the case,
<maiku> Removing OpenOffice_org-gnome solves problems 1.3 and 1.4.

** What is an IM module ?

gtk+:
    gtk modules better than XIM modules:

    + GTK_IM_MODULE=scim
	+ brokenness all over
    + GTK_IM_MODULE=xim ( set XMODIFIERS=@im-scim )
    + GTK_IM_MODULE=uim-anthy

XIM
    + worse but backwards compatible
    + scim
	+ OnTheSpot - dodgy / broken
	+ OverTheSpot - works fine
    + kinput2
	+ works perfectly

SCIM - 
    + works with gtk+ and XIM

UIM - Universal Input Method
    + works with gtk+ and XIM

    "In most GTK+ 2 programs you'll be able to select UIM by
     right-clicking on a text input field without using any special
     setup. However, if you'd like to use it in the old X Input Method
     interface, you should install SCIM in addition to UIM. If your
     only aim is to use Japanese input methods, you could also use the
     helper application uim-xim."

    "UIM is activated by pressing shift + space. For more
     information, have a look at UIM's home page and wiki."

    export GTK_IM_MODULE=uim-anthy
    export XMODIFIERS=@im=uim-anthy
    exec uim-xim&
