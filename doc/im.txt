scim-gtk2-immodule-1.0.1-1.1

** What is an IM module ?

gtk+:
    gtk modules better than XIM modules:

    + GTK_IM_MODULE=scim
	+ brokenness all over
    + GTK_IM_MODULE=xim ( set XMODIFIERS=@im-scim )
    + GTK_IM_MODULE=uim-anthy

XIM
    + worse but backwards compatible
    + scim
	+ OnTheSpot - dodgy / broken
	+ OverTheSpot - works fine
    + kinput2
	+ works perfectly

SCIM - 
    + works with gtk+ and XIM

UIM - Universal Input Method
    + works with gtk+ and XIM

    "In most GTK+ 2 programs you'll be able to select UIM by
     right-clicking on a text input field without using any special
     setup. However, if you'd like to use it in the old X Input Method
     interface, you should install SCIM in addition to UIM. If your
     only aim is to use Japanese input methods, you could also use the
     helper application uim-xim."

    "UIM is activated by pressing shift + space. For more
     information, have a look at UIM's home page and wiki."

    export GTK_IM_MODULE=uim-anthy
    export XMODIFIERS=@im=uim-anthy
    exec uim-xim&
