Notes on transitioning to the new packaging infrastructure

* Requirements of old packaging infrastructure:

  + package-ooo
    + runs setup to install basic files
  + package-lang
    + creates lang_ISO_list.txt files
      + these contain a list of files
      + also contains a list of directories &
        parent directories

* Requirements for hackers:
  + Simple install to a given directory

* Requirements for autobuild/RPM generation
  + need per-language file / directory lists in RPM format
  + need an installed image to package
  + destdir support

* Existing make_installer.pl code
  + -languagepack parameter ?
    + do foo ...
  + runs 'epm'
    + doesn't build a working tree
  + epm files contain the data we want
  + for multiple languages - do we have
    just the files per package (?)

* Other bits
  + DESTDIR support
	+ [ DESTDIR is the removed prefix from the
	    front of the install prefix to the
	    run-time root ]
  + Split out the state into a file (?)
    + split into several passes ?


* External option:
  + parse / collate the relevant epm files
    + extract the data we need
  + do a manual install from the epm files
