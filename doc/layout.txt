Some thoughts on coding up layout.

* Resource compiler
	+ rscdep - dependencies ?
	+ rscpp - pre-processor ?
	+ rsc2 - real compile

* Current design:

	+ All constructed controls:
		+ Control( Window *parent, ... );

	+ Window construction
		+ can pass ResId for toplevel win, but
		  doesn't have to.
		+ ditto for children ...

	+ Window::ImplLoadRes

	+ Show ...

* New stuff:

	+ The high-level API we need is essentialy:
		Window::LayoutChildren();
