Support for qatesttool in ooo-build

You should start with ooo-build/doc/qatesttool.txt to get more information
about the qatesttool itself.

Then you should be prepared to do a full test.


Current process with ooo-build:


1. check our qatesttool for your particular build, for example:
    
    ooo-build/bin/tunnel
    export CVSROOT=:pserver:pmladek@localhost:2401/cvs
    cvs co -r SRC680_m154 qa/qatesttool

2. install OOo you want to test, for example:

    cd ooo-build-ooc680-m2/bin
    ./ooinstall

3. configure testtool, for example:

    cp ooo-build-ooc680-m2/doc/testtoolrc.sample $HOME/.testtoolrc
    /usr/lib/ooo-2.0/program/testtool.bin
    # fix BaseDir, LogBaseDir, HIDDir in Extra/Settings/Profile
    # fix OOoProgramDir in Extra/Settings/Generic
    # stop testtool by File/Exit   [CTRL Q]

4. start the full test:

    ooo-build-ooc680-m2/bin/test-ooo \
	ooo-build-ooc680-m2/etc/test.list \
	ooo-build-ooc680-m2/etc/test.blacklist
    # wait about 4 days until the tests are finished, check it from time
    # to time ;-)

5. Do a fast analyze of the test results, for example:

    ooo-build-ooc680-m2/bin/test-ooo-analyze <LogBaseDir>/*.res

6. Analyze the test results by hand, report bugs, ...


Notes:

1. You can use the script qatesttool/script/unix/OOoTestRun_unix.sh instead of
   ooo-build/bin/test-ooo. I created the script test-ooo because I would like
   to add some more features and better integrate the testtool into oobuild,
   see below.

2. Neither our nor the upstream script runs all the tests. It is because
   some tests are broken and they even could break the other tests.

   For example, qatesttool/framework/basic/f_basic_protected_libraries.bas.
   This test breaks the user configuration, so the other tests are affected
   as well!!!

3. The tests are not well localized. I got much more errors and warnings in
   cs_CZ.UTF-8 locales. Therefore, ooo-build/bin/test-ooo runs the tests in
   the en_US.UTF-8 locales. Also the de_DE.UTF-8 locales might be fine but...



TODO

+ test-ooo improvements:
    + allow to run smoke test
    + read list of actually supported tests from qatesttool/script/unix/*.sh
    + allow to change the various things by options:
	--testtool-bin=
	--testtool-root=
	--skip-to-test=
	--locale=
	...

+ test-ooo-analyze improvements:
    + better comments
    + better statistics ???
    + write statistics into various thematic files ???
    + some options to get various statistics (only errors, list of tests
      with errors, ...) ???

+ better integration with ooo-build:
    + pack / unpack src680-mXXX-qa.bz2
    + add --with-qa configure check
    + allow to use the setting from ooo-build/bin/setup by the
      test-ooo* tools
    + add some makefile targets:
	make install.testtool
    	make test
	make smoketest

+ create a standalone (RPM) package with the qatesttool to be usable with a
  QA department
