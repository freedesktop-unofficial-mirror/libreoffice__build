The internal libdb-4.2 makes problems with java on SL 9.2. There is the same
libdb-4.2.so installed on the system which provides one more symbol
(NTPL related path) and OOo setup ends with:

./javaldx: symbol lookup error: /lib/libnss_ldap.so.2: undefined symbol: __db185
_open
/usr/lib/ooo-1.1/program/setup.bin: symbol lookup error: /lib/libnss_ldap.so.2: 
undefined symbol: __db185_open

It is because OOo setup sets export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/ooo-1.1:/usr/lib/ooo-1.1/program,
so the internal libdb is used also for a java call. The external java is linked
against the system libnss_ldap.so.2 which is linked against the system libdb-4.2
and requires the extra symbol.

It would be better to build OOo with the system libdb. Another problem is that
SUSE's system libdb does not provide the java part.

We actualy rename the internal libdb-4.2.so because the system one
provides the required symbols. It is done in the SUSE's spec file.
