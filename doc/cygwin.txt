Bugs:
	+ tools/toolutils/Makefile.in needs CYGWIN_TOOLS foo ...


Installed ooo.x.c cygwin packages
	  + need to mirror 'pkg-config'
	  + need to mirror libxml2 / libxslt
	  + need to mirror autoconf, wget
	  + need to mirror 'setup.exe'

	  + 'vi' ?

	Un-symlink 'awk' & 'gunzip'

	+ Had to install 'sdkupdate' from MS' site ...
	    + MDAC, Internet Development, & core ...
	    + need to back this up somehow [!]

	+ Run 'command prompt'
	     "c:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003\vc7\bin\vcvars32.bat"
	     cd /cygwin/
	     cygwin.bat

	    + _do not_ run:
		"c:\Program Files\Microsoft SDK\setenv /XP64"
		+ this sets up the path to something nastily broken, a
		  duplicate / duff compiler in the sdk
		+ it also, painfully clobbers the environment.

	    + Control Panel->System->Advanced->Environmental Variables

	    + _Need_ Vc7/atlmfc/include for 'winres.h' in INCLUDES.
		+ really just need to propagate INCLUDES onwards IMHO.

	+ i18npool links to icu - 'icuin.lib' eg.

	+ wdevenv.exe - broken for VS.Net 2003 etc.
	    + need a replacement ... [ why is it necessary anyway ? ]

+ libart ?
	  cygwin's 'dlltool' should do the business though:

	  Mingw: (no run-time cygwin requirement)
	    http://mingw.org/
