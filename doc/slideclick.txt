Slide navigation:

slideshow/source/api/slideshow.cxx (nextEffect):

* Problem (!?)
    + what happens with '<-' ? there is no 'previousEffect' ...

    + Running through a state machine

    + 'addNextEffectHAndler takes 'EventHandlerSharedPtr'

	    -> usereventqueue.cxx:

I just wanted to drop you a line about that "problem" in OpenOffice we
talked about yesterday in your session at Brainshare. The problem is
that it doesn't help a lot to have different ways of advancing slides
between Powerpoint and OpenOffice.


The way Powerpoint does it is just that either the cursor keys or the
space bar advance to the next slide or animation in the current slide.

      [ ie. what space bar does now ... ]


 So for example if I would have a
text box on a slide and would like to have another text box move in
when I'm finished talking to the first one I just press the "next
slide" key/button in Powerpoint.  OpenOffice does this different in as
it also uses the cursor keys/ space bar to go to the next slide but
would skip that animation on the current slide if you use this
method. If you want your animations to complete you'd have to use the
left mouse key.

This becomes even more annoying when using one of these presentation 
remotes as they emulate the cursor keys
for controling Powerpoint instead of the left and right mousekey for 
controling Powerpoint and OpenOffice.

Wouldn't it be great to have either a way of configuring this (luxurious 
version) or just change this to Powerpoints
behavior so that converts can feel themselves at home right away and 
don't get confused a.k.a. frustrated?

I would submit the patch myself would I be able to understand C++ at all :).
