Changes / complexity in splash branding

* Current code just reads intro.bmp from program/

* Help->About code
    + reads file of name from ooo.src
    + images.zip created in instsetoo_native/packimages/makefile.mk
	+ includes file with name from ooo.src via .ilst
    + not included in Gnome though ...

* For now - just hack d.lst to deliver our splash
    + this also grotesquely dithered - by slow loading code.
