Localization of ooo-build features/fixes
========================================

How to regenerate POT/PO files:
-------------------------------

Prerequisite:

    + have to install oo2po tool that is part of translate-toolkit, see
      http://translate.sourceforge.net/wiki/
    + the package for openSUSE is named python-translate-toolkit and
      can be found at
      http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/OpenOffice.org:/EXTRAS/
    + FIXME: put it into the python project in the Build Service

1. do plain build (without patches)
    + ./configure --with-distro=PlainLinux
    + enough to build transex3
2. get upstream strings
    + cd ooo-build/bin
    + ./extract-gsi -d en-US GSI-upstream-en-US.sdf
3. do patched build
    + FIXME: --with-distro=SUSE or apply patches in the plain build
    + again enough to build transex3
4.get ooo-build strings
    ./extract-gsi -d en-US GSI-ooo-build-en-US.sdf
5. get ooo-build-specific strings
    ./extract-new-strings GSI-upstream-en-US.sdf GSI-ooo-build-en-US.sdf GSI-upstream-en-US-new.sdf
6. update ooo-build (SDF/POT/PO files)
    cp GSI-upstream-en-US-new.sdf ooo-build/po/sdf-templates/ooo-build-SUSE.sdf
    cd ooo-build/po
    make update-sdf


How to update PO files:
-----------------------

1. merge the new PO file into exiting one
    + either simply replace the obsolete one
    + use pomerge tool
2. update the prebuild sdf files:
    + make update-sdf

How to get the strings translated:
----------------------------------

+ we will probably get the translation automatically by the GNOME community
    + see http://l10n.gnome.org/module/ooo-build
    + could get more and earlier?
    + follow GNOME project rules
+ another possibility would be to get the translation by openSUSE community
  and Novell:
    + see http://en.opensuse.org/OpenSUSE_Localization_Guide
    + problem with timing because it is synced with openSUSE release
    + translation is not project specific
    + guarantee supported languages


Extra stuff:
------------

    + get SDF for single patch (when upstreaming)
	+ generate reduced sdf_template
	+ generate SDF files for each localization 
	+ merge and sort
	+ bin the en_US strings
    + merge translations from other sources (really needed?)
    + distro-specific translations (do they exist?)
