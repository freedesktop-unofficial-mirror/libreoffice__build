* Recent files get saved in user/config/registry/instance/org/openoffice/Office/Common.xml
  Look for PickList there.

* This gets handled here:
	svtools/inc/historyoptions.hxx
	svtools/source/config/historyoptions.cxx
  It defines class SvtHistoryOptions, which manages several lists; the
  recent files are identified the "ePICKLIST" history type.

* SvtHistoryOptions gets called from wherever "ePICKLIST" appears:
	framework/source/classes/menumanager.cxx
	sfx2/source/appl/appinit.cxx
	sfx2/source/appl/sfxpicklist.cxx <-- especially interesting, why doesn't everything use it?
	sd/source/ui/dlg/dlgass.cxx
