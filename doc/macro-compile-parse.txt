the whole Parse chain is generally set in motion via

SbiModule::Compile
 while ( SbiParser::Parse() )

for the purpose of example consider the following module code

e.g. 

REM  *****  BASIC  *****

Sub Main
n = 52
cMAX = 10.234
Dim mRangeArray(0, 0) as String
ReDim mRangeArray(CInt(cMAX), n) as String
'msgbox (  ("here"), cInt(2) , "foo" )
End Sub

REM and its line contents are practically ignored as they are not compilable content, ditto the blank lines, the Next significate line to be processed is

Sub Main
which initially yields the SUB token, SUB is processed as follows

where 
SbiParser::Parse
   SbiParser::Peek()
   tests for end of file 
      if true ( generates code ( JMP 0 ) for that ) and returns FALSE to terminate the compile
   test for end of line  
      calls Next() and return TRUE ( indicating more stuff to parse )

the main SbiParser::Parse function sets detects the main statements to process like function/subroutine etc. ( keywords are picked up from StmntTable in parser.cxx, note in addition to the Statements the appropriate handlers (functions) are also defined e.g. SbiParser::SubFunc )
   A SUB, FUNCTION or PROPERY results in a  STATEMENT getting generated 

SbiParser::SubFunc
   SbiParser::DefProc
      create a SbiProcdecl by calling SbiParser::ProcDecl
          a new SbiProcDef is created to hold procedure related info e.g. ( scope ( static, public etc. ) params defined for the procedure, local variables, return type )
      if public the SbiProcDecl instance is added to aPublics ( list of public procedures )
      SbiParser::pProc is set to the current procedure
      OpenBlock() is called ( with SUB token )
          creates a SbiParseStack ( and sets SbiParser::pStack to that )
      StmntBlock( ENDSUB )          
          does a while loop on Parse ( e.g. recursive call ) 
          SbiParse::Parse()
1st iter
=========
            processes the tokens e.g. like line 4 "n = 52"
            the first token to be read is n which doesn't match anything token is deemed to be a SYMBOL ( e.g. to be resolved later or at runtime, basically a SYMBOL is a lhs arg or a procedure call )
            a SYMBOL is treated as follows
                strange Next()/Push() call combination where Next() returns the previously "Peeked" SYMBOL, followed by a Push() to ensure Next() will be set up to return SYMBOL again
                a STATEMENT is generated
                SbiParser::Symbol() is called
                    which creates a SbiExpression aVar( this, SbSYMBOL ) [1]
                    peeks at the next symbol to decide whether this is a procedure/object call or EQ ( it is in this case EQ )
                    aVar.Gen( eRecMode ) ( from above ) is called the value of eRecMode refects whether this is EQ or call

                      calls SbiExprNode::GenElement( SbiOpcode eOp )(..) which generates a eOp  _FIND  e.g. ( StepFIND( id, type ) )
		      pGen->Gen( _FIND.... ) where pGen is a SbiCodeGen 
                      note: first call of SbiCodeGen::Gen will generate a statement ( STMNT  ) prior ti the desired type ( so in fact this will generates StepSTMNT(..) followed by StepFIND
                   the above generates the lhs of the assignment
                   for the rhs another SbiExpression is created e.g. SbiExpression aExpr(this) - note the lack a SbSYMBOL in the ctor [3]
                   aExpr.Gen() is called  ( which generated another _FIND (*I think*) )
                   and then a _PUT is forced
2nd iter

         processes newline
2nd iter

         processes cMAX = 10.234

SbiExpression() this class is passed an instance of the parser and all of the work is done in the ctor,
  basically depending of the type passed either
    SbiExpression::Term() or SbiExpression::Boolean() are called which return a SbiExprNode ( )
       SbiExpression::Term()
          can handle a following '.' DOT and associated processing or..
          locks the column ( why? ) pParser->LockColumn
          Peeks at the following TOKEN 
          if the peeked token == ASSIGN
             unlocks the column if its and Assign and returns a new SbiExprNode( represents a single or list of expressions left to right *I think* )
          if its a KeyWord and it's compatible and == INPUT then INPUT is turned into SYMBOL and returned, otherwise an Error is generated ( looks like INPUT has been filtered out here ) - check with other compat filtering to see why here, is this useful for filtering out other vba specific bits?
          the is a check to see if parameters follow
             if so then SbiParameters are created ( which can create further SbiExpressions etc. )
          see if the current symbol ( "n" ) at the stage is in the pParser->pPool or if its in the RTL library e.g. pParser->CheckRTLForSym( aSym, eType );
          if we don't have a symbol definition for the symbol then 
             create a new symbol definition via AddSym[2]
          create a new SbiExprNode          	
          the SbiExprNode always has a valid instance of SbiParameters associated with it ( event if there are no paramaters ) so a new SbiParameters is created 
          column is unlocked and the SbiNode created previously is returned

SbiExpression::SbiExpression calles
    SbiExpression::Boolean() is called for a Standard expression
        SbiExpNode pNd is created for from SbiExpression::Like()
            SbiExpression::Like() calls SbiExprNode* pNd = Cat(), which inturn calls AddSub, Mod, IntDiv, MulDiv, Exp, Unary, 
                in the case of "n = 52" in Unary() pNd is set to result of Operand()
                    Operand()
                        just returns a new SbiExpression for a simple number, result falls back through each of the previous AddSub(), Mod(), IntDiv() etc. calls

A symbol definintion is defined by the SbiSymDef class, it of course defines the name of the symbol, it's type, it's scope, and can of course also define it's own symbols ( e.g. if the symbol is a procedure )

The tokenizer is a strange beast that operates with

Next() & Peek() semantics, 

there is no point talking about how the strings in the module are processed, suffice to say the SbiParser has the following inheritance

SbiScanner
    |
SbiTokenizer
    |
SbiParser

where SbiScanner does the hard lifting wrt parsing the raw lines into Symbols

Peek() 
======

you would think would return the next symbol ( lookahead ) and it *sortof* works like this

if ePush IS NIL then ePush is set to result of Next() ( what sets ePush )

eCurTok is allways set to ePush  ( this is the strange bit for me )
eCurTok is returned

so it seems if you call Peek() you will get the Next() token only if you didn't call Peek() previously


Next()
======
basically if Peek() was called previously ( and then Next() returns the value previoulsy 'Peeked' at ( and sets up ePush to NIL to force either next call to Peek() or next call to Next() to read the next token ) - what makes this strange for me is the fact that Peek() modifies the current token ( e.g. eCurTok )


if ePush ISN'T NIL ( NIL is the initial and terminating state ) eCurTok is set to ePush and ePush is set to NIL

otherwise is gets the next symbol ( via NextSym() which populates aSym )
aSym is compared with the tokens in pTokTable 
   pTokTable contains keywords and symbols like ( &,+,And,Goto,If etc... ) { populated from aTokTable_Basic }
when aSym matches something from pTokTable then it is handled in the 'special' labled code branch ( urky ) c/c++ mix
   'special' branch can cause recursion if the symbol is 'LINE' or 'END' ( this is so END FUNCTION, END SUB, LINE INPUT etc. will be resolved as single tokens
    if the aSym is neither LINE or END then some further magic happens like
        * detecting datatype symbols e.g. INTEGER, DOUBLE, OBJECT etc.
        * detecting As
        * suppressing compatibility only tokens ( like CLASSMODULE, ENUM etc. )
            these are supressed by returning the SYMBOL token
