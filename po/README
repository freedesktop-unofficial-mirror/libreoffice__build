Dear translators,

this directory includes ooo-build-specific localized strings for
OpenOffice.org. You could see three types of files here.

First, the xy.po files provide the translation for the desktop files.
They are maintained using intltool and can be updated the typical
GNOME way, see http://live.gnome.org/TranslationProject/SvnHowTo
for more details.

Second, the ooo-build-xy.po files are used to translate new strings in
the ooo-build patches. They are maintained using the translate-toolkit
tools, see http://translate.sourceforge.net/wiki/start. The ordinary
translators do not need these tools. They could simply edit the .po files
or take the ooo-build.pot file, copy it to a new ooo-build-xy.po and
fill it.

Third, the ooo-build-xy.sdf files are generated from the ooo-build-xy.po files
using the ooo-build/bin/po2sdf script (by make update-sdf). They provide the
strings in the format that is used by the OpenOffice.org build system.

The ooo-build.sdf, ooo-build.pot and also the other .sdf files are regenerated
by the ooo-build developers when necessary (FIXME: we should define official
string freeze...). See also ooo-build/doc/localization.txt for more details.


				    Happy translating,
					    Your ooo-build Team
