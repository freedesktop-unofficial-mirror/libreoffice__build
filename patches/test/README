pagein-idle - the file to use

# artificial italic-bold, italic & bold support for font families that don't 
# provide such fonts. Very import for CJK users
ArtificialBoldItalic.diff:
   basic support, creates artificial fonts in the fontmanager, transforming code for glyphs etc.
psprint-enable-artificial-ItalicBold-printing.diff: 
   enables artificial bold and italic support to be picked up by ps print stuff.

   Notes: 
   pdf print doesn't work, guess this needs a similar patch in 
source/gdi/pdfwriter_impl.cxx. The likely spots are around line 4975 for bold and 4944. Look for "artificial bold necessary " & "perform artificial italics". Of course these patches should not be necessary, it would be rightous to be able to detect artificial bold or italic from ImplFontSelectData or some such class.
  Also worth saying that with these patches I've seen a spurious crash on 
startup, not clear whether its a problem with the patch or a build problem. I'd
suspect the patch.
