ObjectModule.diff contains some bad hacking to try and see how to implement object modules, there is a new sbdocmod.hxx for new class SbDocModule.

problems:
=========

  * the ide doesn't display the module ( no idea why )
  * Document, Form  and Workbook modules should all subclass a common 'ObjectModule' type
  * there are other changes in this patch for moving the VBAFind to the StarBasic class and a failed attempt to try and solve the issue of Sun's helperapi and the vba interop stuff ( from openoffice ) co-existing ( andreas already has fixed that in i75428 ( so that changes about VBAFind can be safely ignored )
  * really on import we need to be able to create the Sheet, Form or Workbook object that the module delegates to. ( there are the usual bootstrap problems ( with ThisComponent ) though when trying to create the vba objects ( on document load before the document is active )

ps the object module code in the diff is really really crap, I only am keeping it as a diff here so I can return to my experiments later, e.g. this code is not meant to be a basis of any real code
