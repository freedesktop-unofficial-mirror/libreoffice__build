All patches in this directory are automatically applied in alphabetical order.
They are applied after the "regular" patches mentioned in the apply file. Only
files with the .diff suffix are processed.

It is intended for distributors that would like to add some patches to an
already released ooo-build. It is enough to copy the patch here after the
ooo-build tarball is unpacked. It is not longer needed to create patches
against ooo-build (patches against patches).

Please, do not commit any patches in this directory into ooo-build SVN.
Use the normal process via the apply file instead.
