Elements can be each a number (including negatives), a logical constant (TRUE, FALSE), or a literal string. Non-constant expressions are not allowed. Arrays can be entered with one or more rows, and one or more columns. All rows must consist of the same number of elements, all columns must consist of the same number of elements. </paragraph>
