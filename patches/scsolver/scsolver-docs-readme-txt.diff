+== HOW TO COMPILE UNO PACKAGE ==
+
+
+=== scsolver.uno.zip ===
+
+To compile a separate UNO package named scsolver.uno.zip, which can be 
+installed on a version of OO.o that doesn't have this Solver 
+pre-installed, follow these steps.  
+
+1.  You need to compile the normal build process for the entire 
+application in order to populate the global outout directory with all 
+necessary headers and libraries.  The global output directory is located 
+at 
+
+  <basedir>/solver/680/unxlngi6.pro
+
+where the directory name "unxlngi6.pro" may be different depending upon 
+platforms and target architecture.  
+
+2.  Move into scsolver/workben/addon_pkg and type 'make'.  If all goes 
+well, you should see a file named scsolver.uno.zip sitting in that same 
+directory.
+
+
+=== lpsolve.uno.zip ===
+
+To compile lpsolve.uno.zip, you need to first download lpsolve 5.5 source 
+package, place it in 
+
+  scsolver/workben/external/
+
+and unpack it.  The source package is available from 
+http://sourceforge.net/projects/lpsolve.  Upon unpacking, a new directory 
+named lp_solve_5.5 will be created with all source files under it.  Go 
+ahead and build its static and dynamic libraries by 
+
+  cd lp_solve_5.5/lpsolve55
+  sh ccc
+
+This will build liblpsolve55.a and liblpsolve55.so in that directory.
+
+Now, go back up to scsolver/workben/external, and move into lpsolve_uno 
+directory.  Then simply type make to build lpsolve.uno.zip.
