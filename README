OpenOffice.org build:

	This package contains Desktop integration work for
OpenOffice.org, several back-ported features & speedups, and a much
simplified build wrapper, making an OO.o build / install possible for
the common man.[1]

	The latest version of this code can be obtained by
anonymous Git with this command:

	git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/ooo-build/ooo-build

	Packaged releases can be found from:

		http://download.go-oo.org/

	More documentation is in the

		git://anongit.freedesktop.org/ooo-build/website

repository, the latest version of which is also at http://go-oo.org/

	Finally, you can subscribe to the development mailing list at
http://lists.freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/ooo-build

	Happy hacking.

[1] - assuming the common man has 4Gb+ of spare space, and lots of
      idle CPU time.
