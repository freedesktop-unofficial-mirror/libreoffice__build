OpenOffice.org build:

	This package contains Desktop integration work for
OpenOffice.org, several back-ported features & speedups, and a much
simplified build wrapper, making an OO.o build / install possible for
the common man.[1]

	The latest version of this module can be obtained from
anonymous SVN with this command:

	svn co http://svn.gnome.org/svn/ooo-build/trunk ooo-build

	Packaged releases can be found from:

		http://download.go-oo.org/

	More documentation is in the www/ directory the latest version
of which is available at http://go-oo.org/

	Finally, you can subscribe to the development mailing list at
http://lists.go-oo.org/listinfo.cgi/dev-go-oo.org

	Happy hacking.

[1] - assuming the common man has 4Gb+ of spare space, and lots of
      idle CPU time.
