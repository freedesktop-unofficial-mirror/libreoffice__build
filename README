This LibreOffice "build" git repository is obsolete; in fact it is so obsolete
that the repository which replaced it is already obsolete as well.

If you are interested in the latest and greatest development branch "master",
or in release branches of LibreOffice versions newer than 3.4, please
check out the "core" git repository, as described on the Wiki:

  http://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development/Native_Build

If you want to build the 3.3 or 3.4 release, check out the (obsolete)
"bootstrap" git repository, as described on the Wiki:

  http://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development/Native_Build_From_Bootstrap

If for some reason you want to look at obsolete in-development code,
check out the "master-backup" branch in this repository; this is most likely
to be a complete waste of time though.
