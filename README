* Welcome to LibreOffice *

	Welcome to LibreOffice. This package is just a shim that sits
around, and makes it easy to work with the bulk of the code. This is
downloaded from a source archive, or git (if configured with
--with-git) by the download.sh shell script.

	You will need around 6Gb of spare disk space to build, install
and have space to have a copy or two. The latest version of this code
can be obtained by anonymous Git with this command:

	$ git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/git/libreoffice/build

	To update the git repositories to the latest versions run:

	$ git pull -r ; bin/g pull -r

	Packaged releases can be found from:
		http://www.documentfoundation.org/download/

	More documentation is in the wiki:
		http://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development/How_to_build

	Finally, you can subscribe to the development mailing list at
http://lists.freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/libreoffice and please
share your pain and frustration with build issues on IRC at
irc.freenode.net in #libreoffice.

	Happy hacking.
