New test documents should be 
    * self testing, individual failures should be documented at the end of a test run. If possible expected results should be included in any test report. use TestFormula.xls, TestAddress.xls, MiscRangeTests.xls as examples
    * Excel documents not Openoffice documents, we want to test import and run of Excel documents.
        * there may be circumstances where it is necessary to have a '.ods' document to facilitate testing, but, in general this should be avoided if possible.

Document breakdown 

self testing
============
TestFormula.xls works
TestAddress.xls works
MiscRangeTests.xls works
TestColWidthRowHeight.xls ( mostly works, some small problems, and one BIG performance one 'test11' fails

demoish
=======
interaction.xls  ( mostly ) works ~ 95% ( or more ) also should be added to missing_vbafeatures.xls
ExcelExamples.xls ( actually is the identical to the above but more more examples, interaction.xls should probably be deleted )
hypocycloid-demo.xls 	works
somecontrolsinteraction.xls works
worm.xls	works
simpleanimationchart.xls 	works
clock chart.xls definitely dosn't work we don't implement chart api

misc
====
ConstCheck.xls works but should be more self testing
vbatest.xls	seems to work ( not sure )
SimpleXlCellTypeConstDemo.xls (half works)
macrobook.xls ( some things work, others don't, the don't work bits need to be documented in missing_vbafeatures.xls )

ods variants
============
in general ignore these ( probably should be removed but should be examined for test content that can be extracted into new self testing xls documents )
