Converting the test documents to vba interop api.
=================================================

Converting the helperapi test documents. To convert one of the helperapi test documents please follow the following manual tests

1) replace the TestLogMacros module in the document with the new TestLogMacros ( remove the one in the document and import the .bas file )


please note: the steps below are no longer necessary: noelp Sep, 07

2) next we need to convert the other modules, first click on the module to convert, right click and select Remove 'Module', select the export option

3) call tweakModule 'Module'

4) import converted 'Module' back into document

o background
    TestLogMacros.bas - is a replacement for the excel version of TestLogMacros modules that exists in the test documents.  This main difference is that the logfile location is determined either from a hardcoded path ( 'c:\HelperApi-vba.log' ) or the default document location e.g. ~/Documents/HelperApi-vba.log' ) depending on whether the macro is run from openoffice or excel

2) convert the test macros in in test document.


ChartAxes.xls - an example of the original test cases

ChartAxes-oovbaapi.xls - the testcases converted so that they will run with the vba interop solution ( openoffice ) 

   main changes you generally need to make are to cater for optional parameters e.g. such as the function  

   Sub TestLog_ASSERT(assertion As Boolean, Optional testId As String, Optional testComment As String)

The helperapi test documents located in api/helperapi/test_documents/*.idl call this methods in the following way

TestLog_ASSERT (bSuccessful = True), "Chart successfully selected"

but this calling convention this generates compile errors in openoffice...

the following variant will also fail to compile in excel
 
TestLog_ASSERT( (bSuccessful = True), "Chart successfully selected" )

but... the following will work both in openoffice and excel

Call TestLog_ASSERT( (bSuccessful = True), "Chart successfully selected" )

so the tweakxxxx script(s) change the calling convertion to something that works in both openoffice and excel
