Converting the test documents to vba interop api.

1) replace the TestLogMacros module in the document with the new TestLogMacros ( remove the one in the document and import the .bas file )

o background
    TestLogMacros.bas - is a replacement for the excel version of TestLogMacros modules that exists in the test documents.  This main difference is that the logfile location is determined either from a hardcoded path ( 'c:\HelperApi-vba.log' ) or the default document location e.g. ~/Documents/HelperApi-vba.log' ) depending on whether the macro is run from openoffice or excel

2) convert the test macros in in test document.

ChartAxes.xls - an example of the original test cases

ChartAxes-oovbaapi.xls - the testcases converted so that they will run with the vba interop solution ( openoffice ) 

   main changes you generally need to make are to cater for optional parameters e.g. such as the function  

   Sub TestLog_ASSERT(assertion As Boolean, Optional testId As String, Optional testComment As String)

The helperapi test documents located in api/helperapi/test_documents/*.idl call this methods in the following way

TestLog_ASSERT (bSuccessful = True), "Chart successfully selected"

but... this generates compile errors in openoffice

also the following variant will also fail to compile
 
TestLog_ASSERT( (bSuccessful = True), "Chart successfully selected" )

but... the following will work both in openoffice and excel

Call TestLog_ASSERT( (bSuccessful = True), "Chart successfully selected" )
