In a simple build scenario / to get started use:

./build-ooo OOO_STABLE_1 --checkout

then (you need to be a sudoer):

./package-ooo OOO_STABLE_1 --clean

Other files:

  setup.in		- misc. configuration options
  install-icons		- install artwork and icons, re-scale
			  existing icons using ImageMagic.
  tinder-build		- used on the tinderbox to build and
			  package OO.o in a loop.

	 		  an installed set.

			  maps.

			  install image.
  ootouch               - utility - give it some of your stack trace,
			  and it will go touch files contianing that,
