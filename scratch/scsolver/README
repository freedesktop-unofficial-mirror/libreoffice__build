== HOW TO COMPILE SCSOLVER UNO PACKAGE ==

To compile the separate UNO package named scsolver.uno.zip that can be 
installed on a version of OO.o that doesn't have the Solver pre-installed, 
follow these steps.  

1. First, you need to have OO.o itself installed somewhere on your system, and
   the version of OO.o SDK compatible with your OO.o installation.

2. Download, unpack and build the lp_solve library in a separate directory.  
   You can download the lp_solve 5.5.0.10 package from our mirror.  To do it, 
   run these commands in this order:

   wget http://download.go-oo.org/SRC680/lp_solve_5.5.0.10_source.tar.gz
   tar xvf lp_solve_5.5.0.10_source.tar.gz
   cd lp_solve_5.5/lpsolve55
   sh ccc

3. Now, change directory into workben/addon_pkg, and create and run configure.

   cd workben/addon_pkg
   ./autogen.sh
   ./configure \
       --with-ooo=/path/to/ooo/install \
       --with-ooo-sdk=/path/to/ooo/sdk \
       --with-lpsolve=/path/to/lpsolve

   NOTE 1) Use absolute path to specify the location of the OO.o installation,
   OO.o SDK, and the base lpsolve path.  Do not use a relative path, or the 
   build will fail!

   NOTE 2) At the moment, this configure script does not verify the paths given
   to the configure script.  So make sure the above paths are correct.

4. If all goes well, simply run make to build scsolver.uno.zip.

   make

5. At this point, you can launch OO.o Calc and manually install this package
   from GUI, or you can do this from the command line:

   make install

   this will execute the 'unopkg add' command to register scsolver.uno.zip.
