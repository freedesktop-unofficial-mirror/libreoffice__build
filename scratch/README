	This directory is for playgrounds where we need to collaborate,
and patches are too painful.

	It's prolly best to symlink these directories directly into your
OO.o source-tree in-place, the POSITION files specify where each file
set belongs. eg.

	ln -s /foo/baa/ooo-build/scratch/sc-vba \
	      /baa/foo/src680-m102/sc/source/ui/vba

	Then hack away in src680-m102/sc/source/ui/vba and commit in
ooo-build with suitable ChangeLog regularly.
