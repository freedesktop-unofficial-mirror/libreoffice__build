	This directory is for playgrounds where we need to collaborate,
and patches are too painful.

	It's prolly best to move these directories directly into your
OO.o source-tree and symlink them back to ooo-build, the POSITION
files specify where each file set belongs. eg.

	cvs=/abs/path/to/ooo-build/scratch/sc-vba; \
	build=/abs/path/to/src680-m102/sc/source/ui/vba; \
	mv $cvs $build; \
	ln -s $build $cvs

	Then hack away in src680-m102/sc/source/ui/vba and commit in
ooo-build with suitable ChangeLog regularly.
