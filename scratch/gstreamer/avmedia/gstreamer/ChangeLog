	* gstwindow.hxx: removed mpWndClass for now, so that the rest
	compiles

	* gstuno.cxx (component_getFactory): s/DirectX/GStreamer so that
	component is loaded

	* gstplayer.cxx (Player::Player): do not create gerror object, it
	is noit needed, free the error object only if created during

	(create): fixed ascURL declaration, added rtl namespace prefix

	missing NULL to the end of g_object_set call

	* gstplayer.hxx: keep g_main_loop only on win platform. make
	mnUnmutedVolume double, moved mbInitialized to the end to quiet
	compiler warning

	* gstcommon.hxx: removed wrong #include <rtl/ustring>

	* renamed source files, prefixed the names with gst so that obj
	file names do not clash with xine object files

	* makefile.mk: changed PRJNAME and TARGET to reflect
	gstreamer. enabled build on unix as well. removed win library
	references. removed source files which are not yet ported from
	SLOFILES list.
