Teaming & Conferencing experimental hacks...

1) Apply patch: patches/src680/sw-team-pane.diff
   and compile office.
   Assume office is installed in /tmp/ooo (e.g. by ooinstall /tmp/ooo)

2) Complie SamplePlug App and create link from office program dir to the
   Sampleapp. OOo will look for TeamApp.

   mcs -pkg:gtk-sharp SamplePlug.cs
   mkbundle -o SamplePlug SamplePlug.exe 
   ln -s SampleApp /tmp/ooo/program/TeamApp

   
3) Start soffice, e.g. /tmp/ooo/programm/soffice and create empty doc...
   Team Pane should be place at the right side.

** ALL EXPRIMENTAL AND WITH LOTS OF PRINTF... **

TODO / PLAN:
* Use the Mono Plug-in framework. I.e. the TeamApp should use the mono plug-in
framework to start the custom app...
* Make the TeamApp and OOo communicate via UNO.

Have fun!
